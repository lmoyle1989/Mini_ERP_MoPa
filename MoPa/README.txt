This is a mini-ERP/Inventory/Sales web app. It is a very basic bare bones version of something akin to the enterprise software used at a manufacturing company.
It uses MariaDB and expresss in node.js for the backend, and the frontend is done with handlebars for templating. The frontend is almost purely HTML due to the nature of this being a database interface exploration, but I think the actualy user interface is intuitive and easy to use. It could be spruced up with some CSS or redone with a framework.

See database outline/schema .pdf file in this repo for more information and operational screenshots.
